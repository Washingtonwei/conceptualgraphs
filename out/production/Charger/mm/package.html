Classes for managing Mental Models (MM) and metrics related to data acquired in MMAT experiments.
Mental models are conceptual graphs created by users under controlled conditions (usually a constrained
CG editor) so that they can be compared and analyzed. The CGs are all assumed to reside in a single
folder, which is the folder from which Charger should be reading when it is launched (see the -p command 
line argument to Charger). There is an auxiliary folder, with the same parent as the startup folder,
called "Saved" that may contain models that are in progress. A few MM classes may access this "sideways" folder 
in order to tell if a model is valid or not.

<p>Some terminology will be helpful:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Project</dt>
    <dd>A long term effort for collecting models. Often there will only be one active project in a given time period.</dd> 
    <dd>A set of groups, where a group is usually a course (e.g., "py102") or any other group of subjects.</dd>
    
    <dt>Group</dt>
    <dd>A set of teams, all either part of a course (e.g., "py102") or any other group of subjects.</dd>
    
    <dt>Team</dt>
    <dd>The basic unit of analysis in this research -- a collection of each team member's models over the 
    phases of project life (see Phase below)</dd>
    <dd>There should be three team-phases for a completely acquired team.</dd>

    <dt>Team-Phase</dt>
    <dd>A set of models, one for each team member, all acquired at the same phase of project life (beginning, middle, end)</dd>

    <dt>Phase</dt>
    <dd>A point in time at which a particular model is acquired. For example, one version of these experiments
        gathers models at the beginning, middle and end of a process. Each such time is the phase attribute of 
        a model.</dd>

    <dt>Component Kind</dt>
    <dt>Kind</dt>
    <dd>A point of view with respect to a user's model, focusing on either concepts (congruence, singletons, etc.) or relations/tuples. 
    Since most of the metrics involve similar calculations for each, it is useful to consider this as an additional dimension.</dd>
    
    <dt>Model</dt>
    <dd>A single instance of a user's model. Acquired by an interactive user editor, these are
        then stored as a cgx file for Charger (and MM) to read.</dd>
    
    <dt>Distinct concept/tuples</dt>
    <dd>The set of concepts (or tuples, etc.) that are distinct from one another. These are derived
        from the point of view of a matcher. It is intended that no distinct concept matches any other
        distinct concept. Likewise for relationship tuples and any other feature being analyzed.</dd>

    <dt>Coreferent set</dt>
    <dt>Counterpart set</dt>
    <dd>The set of concepts (or tuples, etc.) that all refer to the same thing/individual.  This may be
        established by using synonyms for matching, or a regular match. By whatever means it is established,
        its meaning is that all concepts in the set are counterparts to each other in their respective models.
        Each distinct concept (whether there's actually one or multiple concepts) forms a coreferent set, although
        in many cases, the "set" consists of just one concept. </dd>

    <dt>Singleton</dt>
    <dd>A component (concept or tuple) that appears in exactly one model of a group.</dd>

</dl>
<p>
    Metrics are generally considered to hold over a set of two or more models. For different purposes, different
    combinations of models can be analyzed for each team. The following analysis methods are supported:
<ul>
    <li>Team congruence - the measures of how much agreement there exists between models. Depending on the parameters chosen,
        a special "observer" and/or a special "combined" model may be included in the set of models.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pair-wise congruence - the measures of model agreement treated entirely between pairs of models. Again, observer and/or
        combined models may or may not be included.
    </li>
    <li>
        Group-as-team congruence - this measures an entire group of teams all as a single team. In effect this measures the levels 
        of overall congruence between every model in the group.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
    The models themselves are stored in an MTeamPhase object. Each MTeamPhase object also contains an MCongruenceMetrics object for
    both concepts and relations. An MTeamMetrics object is used purely for assembling the analysis results for output.
